The right path winds gently through a stretch of dry trees.
Their bark is cracked like old paint, and the roots beneath your feet crunch with
every step. It’s quieter here. No stench, no movement.
Only your own breath for company.
Hours pass— or maybe just minutes. It’s hard to tell. Time bends strangely when you've
been travelling for so long, it bends in the woods.

Eventually, you feel your legs beginning to ache.
You settle onto a fallen log and dig through your pack.

Bread. Cold. Hard as a rock. Still, it’s better than nothing.
You eat in silence, watching the wind move sluggishly through the trees.
For a moment, it’s almost peaceful.
