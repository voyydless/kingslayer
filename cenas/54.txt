#54
The main road that cuts through the city was too open, too visible. You step off the
path, into overgrown brush, and begin the long walk along the wall’s perimeter.
What was once a pristine outer garden is now a cemetery of vines and twisted iron.
Thorned branches tug at your cloak. Statues of saints and scholars peer out from cracked
alcoves, their faces long since worn away, the Rot even digging into stone.

Every few steps, your boot crunches something dry— a twig, or a bone, it’s hard to say.
The wall looms high above you now. Once meant to keep out invaders.
Now it keeps in silence.

You find a place where the stone has eroded, weathered by rain that shouldn’t fall and
time that shouldn’t pass. The climb won’t be easy, but it’s your best chance.

You check the straps on your gauntlet, dig your fingers into the crevices of the wall, and begin to climb.

SORTE
#55: You climb.
#56: You climb— you fall.
