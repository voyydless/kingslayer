#39
You strikeâ€” but the Rotten moves faster than death should allow.
It lurches up with a shriek that peels the inside of your skull.
Fingers like broken twigs rake across your chest, tearing leather and skin alike.
You stumble back, sword slick with your own blood.
Pain flares hot across your ribs.
You manage a second strike, enough to bring the thing down.

Death is mercy, you aim to provide it.
Perhaps it just wanted to provide the same for you.

#52: Move forward, the Royal city is close by.
