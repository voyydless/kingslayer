#55
You press your fingers into weather-worn grooves, boots scraping against stone slick with
moss, ash and rot. Each foothold is a prayer, each movement deliberate.
The wind picks up.
You’re halfway when the stones begin to shift beneath your weight. Not much, but enough
to stir dread in your gut. One wrong move and the wall won’t forgive you.

You exhale, steady your breath, and continue.

SORTE
#57: You climb.
#58: You climb— you fall.
