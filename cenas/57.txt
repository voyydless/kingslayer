#57
Your foot slipsâ€” just once, and your heart slams against your ribs like a caged animal.
But you catch yourself, press in closer to the wall, and crawl up the last few feet.
Your armoured arm drags against stone. Fingers brush flatness. You grip the edge with the
one still made of flesh. With a final heave, you drag yourself up into a window, and fall
inside. For a moment, you collapse there, catching your breath.

Standing up, you stare outside. The city below disappears in mist and smoke.
You can hardly believe you made it. You can hardly believe you're alive.
Taking in your surroundings, the interior of the castle is less a palace and more a tomb;
a mausoleum built to house a still-living god.
No guards. No servants. No signs of life save for the faint flickering of torches lined
against the wall.

You walk. Every step echoes.
The doors creak open before you touch them. Either the wind, or something watching.
The throne room waits just ahead.

#69: Enter.
