#12
You strike, but your balance is off. The floorboards betray youâ€” slick with drink or worse.
The soldier moves like a man with nothing left to lose. He catches your wrist mid-swing and
slams your head against the edge of the table.
The world tilts sideways.
You wake up on a bed, the taste of blood is thick in your mouth.
"You're alive after all." The barkeep stares down at you, the tavern must be closed.
"The soldier..."
"Ran away. He was barely holding on anyways, Rot had taken a deep root, your little brawl
pushed him past his limits. At best he'll be dead by the sunrise, at worst..."
"Some mindless creature." A plump woman pops her head in through the doorway. Her cheeks
aren't rosy, they're cold, bloated. "For what it's worth... thank you. We wanted him gone."

You feel your consciousness start to drift again.

#16: Next thing you know, it's morning.
