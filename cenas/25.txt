#25
You sit on the bed, sketch in hand. The tree feels... familiar. Not just from dreams, but
from somewhere real, something buried in your memory.
As you stare, the lines seem to shift. The roots writhe against the page, snaking toward your fingers.
You drop it with a curse.

At the edge of your vision, the window shows the street outsideâ€” only now, dozens of shadowy figures
line the road, standing motionless, all facing the tavern. Waiting.
Was it for you?
You hear the tavern door creak open downstairs.
The same exact sound you heard before.

Something is terribly wrong, you're not awake.

#26: Force yourself to wake up.
#27: Descend further into the dream.
#28: Rip up the drawing, it must be causing this.
