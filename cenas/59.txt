#59
You look behind you and stare outside a window.
The Royal City of Caedros below disappears in mist and smoke.
You can hardly believe you made it. You can hardly believe you're alive.
Taking in your surroundings, the interior of the castle is less a palace and more a tomb;
a mausoleum built to house a still-living god.
No guards. No servants. No signs of life save for the faint flickering of torches lined
against the wall.

You walk. Every step echoes.
The doors creak open before you touch them. Either the wind, or something watching.
The throne room waits just ahead.

#69: Enter.
