The path tightens.
The trees twist around each other, strangling the sky, letting in only a sickly,
grey light. Roots claw at your ankles, branches scrape your face.
The stench grows stronger with every step— the bitter, metallic reek of something long
dead, yet still festering.
Ahead, the ground slopes downward.
The trees thin.
And there, you see it.

A tree— if it could still be called that.

Its bark is blackened and slick, weeping foul sap that hisses when it touches the earth.
Its roots pulse and writhe like the veins of a living corpse.
Above, where branches should be, only skeletal tendrils reach into the sky, clutching at nothing.

And at its center, a gaping wound. The very heart of the Rot.
You feel it pull at you, like the tide at a drowning man.
There is no mistaking it now.
This is the source.

This is what the King has fed.
What has been devouring the land, the people, the very soul of this kingdom.

#45: Step closer.
#46: Try to resist the pull.
#47: Flee.
