#17
You stay still for a moment, letting the silence settle.
Then you move. Quietly, Carefully. Someone had been in here, you had to find out who.
Your hands search the drawers, the shelves, the cracks between the floorboards.
Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing to go off of, not even dust.
It’s as if no one has ever stayed in this room before.

You check under the bed.
There, tucked into the shadows, you spot it: another slip of paper, stained at the edges.
As you reach for it, he cold brush of something unseen grazes your fingers.
You snatch the paper away quickly, heart hammering.
It’s a rough sketch— a gnarled, leafless tree, its roots twisting down into black soil.
And just like the note, there was nothing to point to who had made it.

You frown. You've seen this tree before.

#24: Keep searching the room.
#25: Study the drawing more closely.
