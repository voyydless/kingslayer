#71
Your blade finds the gap in his chestplate.
He stumbles. Kneels. Still, he makes no sound.
You drive the blade in deeper.

His hand lifts, not in defense, but in what seems to be... gratitude?
With shaking fingers, he unfastens the helm.
It falls to the floor with a dull clang.

His face is not one of a man, not one of the Rotten, it is a ruin.
Skin paper-thin, drawn tight over bone. Lips cracked, eyes sunken, dark as voids.
He is a corpse, he has long been dead.
He blinks slowly, then smiles, more sadness than relief.

“...thank you,” he whispers.
And then he crumbles to ash.

And yet, the rot does not leave. The castle does not brighten. The sun does not rise.
Instead, you feel it. A stirring.
Like something choosing.
Your knees give out. Your breath catches.

You look at your hand, the one you still have. It’s darkening.

The Rot has found a new monarch.
