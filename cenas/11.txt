One, two, three strikes to his chest. Blood coughs from his mouth.
His blade clatters to the floor. Your knee pins him down as your sword slits his neck.
It’s quick. Merciful, if such a thing exists anymore.
His eyes are glazed over, you feel no remorse. If you hadn't killed him, the
Rot would've done it sooner than later. It’s leaking from where you cut his neck,
black and gleaming, crawling like oil along his skin. It pools around your feet, smells
of rust and rot and something older. Something wrong.
The tavern guests stop their staring the moment it's over, must be used to this sort of thing.
A woman plump from unhealthy water weight comes from behind the bar and starts to clean
up the mess.
"Finally someone did it," the barkeep speaks up. "Can't stand king's men, but we know better
than to mess with them. Thought the Rot would take him sooner, he turned out to be quite
resilient."
"Don't suppose you'd have a room to offer your saviour?" you ask. He cackles.
"Can't say no to that. 5 gold a night, but I'll throw in a meal for doing us a favour."

P: 1

#13: "I have a question... the Rot seems stronger than usual here. Why?"
#16: You nod in appreciation and head to your room. "Goodnight."
