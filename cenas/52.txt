#52
The Royal City of Caedros.

Once, its white stone walls shimmered in the sun, a crown of beauty atop the spine of the
kingdom. The streets had been carved from pale granite, polished and swept daily. Ivy had
curled over old archways like green lace. It was said the bells of Caedros could be
heard even in the furthest farms— and that every man, woman, and child in the realm had
once dreamed of walking its streets.

Now, the city does not shimmer. It weeps.

The air here is thicker, heavier. A haze clings low to the ground, curling like smoke,
carrying with it the scent of metal and mildew. The gates are ajar, rusted open, and the
once golden sigils above them have rotted black.

No guards.
No cries.
No welcome.

And yet… they knew you were coming.
You can feel them. Watching from behind shuttered windows and cracked doors, their breath
held like coins in their mouths. The people still live here, but they are buried in fear.

You take a breath, and look up.
The castle rises high above the city on its inner hill, its golden towers eaten away at the
edges, its banners now tattered strips of cloth. You’ve come this far.

#53: Enter the city through the main gate.
#54: Circle around and scale the wall, straight the the castle.
