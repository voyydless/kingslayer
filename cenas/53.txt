#53
The gates of the city are tall things, older than the crown they defend.
The rot hasn’t spared them, a faint stench clings to the surface, old blood or worse.

You press against them and they groan open, slow as if protesting your arrival.

The streets are wide, but every door is shut. Every window is shuttered.
You feel eyes on you, though no one looks out. The city knew you were coming. It had time to hide.
A doll lies face down in the mud, one button eye scraped clean off.
You hear the clinking of armour— the guards were on alert, they knew you'd arrived.
From the footsteps, you could tell there were two, one heavier, one lighter.
As they approached, you could see them better. One Ursae, one Leporidae.
They were coming from different directions.

#60: Take on the Ursae first.
#61: Take on the Leporidae first.
