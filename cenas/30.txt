#30
You fall to your knees before the tree.
It leans down, its bark splitting, black sap oozing toward you like a living thing.
You do not resist. It sinks into your wounds, into your mouth, into your eyes.
You feel yourself unraveling, thread by thread, memory by memory.

When you open your eyes again, you are standing on the castle steps.
You feel strong. Whole.
You feel nothing at all.
You look down at your armâ€” it is untouched, pristine.
But when you move, the skin beneath it cracks and weeps black rot.

You smile, but you do not know why.

The king waits.
