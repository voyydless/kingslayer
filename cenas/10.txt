You move fast. Faster than he expects.
Your metal hand slams his tankard aside, sending it clattering to the floor, the
liquid hissing where it splashes. No wonder why he hadn't drank it. The moment he reaches
for his sword again, yours is already half-drawn.

Steel screams against steel.
The fight is far from elegant. Two bodies trying to outlast the other.
He’s stronger— has the weight of armor and years, but you have speed, desperation, and hate.
He lands a blow against your arm, scraping sparks off of metal. If you hadn't cut it off
all those years ago, you would've lost your arm at that very instant.
You drive your metal fist into his throat in return. He stumbles, but doesn't stop.
Nor do you.
