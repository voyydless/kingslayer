His armour’s stained, dented. The gold trim is mostly flaked off, only visible around the
collar where his helmet would sit. Ursae. You could tell his rank from the details on his
uniform, they were the heavy hitters, the brutes. Perhaps he was once as large as a bear,
as large as his armour suggested he was, but now it served as a hollow shell.
His face is gaunt, lips cracked. A tankard rests untouched in front of him.
“What do you want?” He says, before you can speak.

#9: “What’s a soldier doing in a town like this?”
#10: Strike before he can process it.
#4: Say nothing.  Go up to the barkeep.
