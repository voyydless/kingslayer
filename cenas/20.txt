You turn sharply, hand gripping the hilt at your side. Fog coils at your boots,
thick and heavy, distorting shapes and sound.
Out of it steps a man— a hunter.
He’s broad-shouldered, heavy with muscle but moving light on his feet.
His cloak is ratty but thick, patched with the hides of creatures not found this side
of the forest. His armor is mismatched, but well polished.
Pieces taken from the dead, no doubt.

His face is young, scarred at the jawline, long hair tied into a knot.

"You’re worth a lot of coin, you know that?" he says, voice easy, like this was a conversation
at a tavern table and not the edge of death. "Dead or alive. Guess which one’s easier for me."
He shifts his stance, boots crunching on the gravel. You notice his hand twitch,
a small movement toward a throwing knife strapped to his belt.

He isn’t here to talk.
