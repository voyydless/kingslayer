#24
You leave the paper on the bed and press on, searching the walls, the floor, the corners.
There’s a heaviness to the air now, like the room itself is watching.
You check the window— outside, the streets are... wrong.
Too still. The gray sky looks painted on, unmoving.
No wind.
No sound.
You blink.
The stew on the table is steaming again; fresh, warm. It was as cold as ice
when you'd first woken up, you hear the same creaking of the stranger exiting the tavern.
Looking down, the note is back in your hand.
A distorted voice from beneath the bed hisses in a language you couldn't understand,
but you knew what it was saying: 'You'll never wake up.'

#26: Force yourself to wake up.
#27: Descend further into the dream.
