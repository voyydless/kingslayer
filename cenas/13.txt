"You're awful bad a playing dumb, I know the look in your eyes. You know why"
You did. "It's all because of him."
The King. No one alive was old enough to remember a time before him, but
tales were told, books were readâ€” people dreamt about what life was like before
the Rot took root. They say grass used to be green, trees used to have leaves;
rivers were full and the rain didn't burn your skin.
People still died, sometimes horribly, but never a death so awful as the one
that slowly eats you inside out, turning your organs into those of a corpse while
you struggled to live on. Animals sometimes still suffered losses,
but never so much as having an entire litter be born as wriggling corpses.
"When my forefathers build up Mensfield, it was a place men came to be free. Now,
it's where the King sends his Rotten soldiers to die, to infect our land even further."

"Do you believe the Rot will die when he does?" You ask.
"Does it make a difference what I think?"
"No."
He laughs. "Rest well."

You'll try. You'll need it.

#16: You settle into the room. Next thing you know, it's morning.
