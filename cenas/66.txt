#66
The streets narrow. Cobblestone veins twist between rotting houses, their doors
long-since splintered by either time or desperation. Their inhabitants stay inside, watching you.
The close you get to the castle, the more luxuriou the housing becomes, yet none seem to
have escaped from the passage of time. You’ve been walking for hours.
There was an ache behind your knees, s weight in your shoulders.
The city stretches on like a grave that forgot to end.

You pass a fountain. Once marble, now sickly green, crusted with moss.
At its center, a statue of the first king of this land— head missing, vines crawling up the empty
space where a crown once sat. You wonder if he’d weep, if he could see what his bloodline wrought.

#68: Enter the gates.
