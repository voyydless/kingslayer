Mensfield was the name of the town you were walking into, at one time, it
might’ve been awfully on the nose.  Now, there were a few hundred inhabitants,
it was a wonder how they managed to make it out here— the fields were dried and
shriveled, awfully difficult to live off the land when the land wasn’t alive itself.
You take in your surroundings while looking for a tavern, broken fences,
doors hanging on hinges, everything reeks of Rot.

#3: Enter the tavern.
