He wants you to do this, so that his reign can go on.
It clings to your thoughts like cobwebs. Your feet sink deeper into the earth as roots
try to anchor you— but you push back.
You think of the road, the people you’ve met, the pain that shaped you.
You think of the note, the dream, the barkeep’s wife, the guard’s blood on your clothes.
You think of who you used to be— and who you are now.

The pressure breaks.
The world spins. Your legs go weak— but you do not fall.
The path behind you closes.
Now you can only stagger forward.
