#65
She’s too fast.
You try to read her, but her style is chaos, misdirection, flickers of motion
in the corner of your eye. A blade slips under your ribs. Another into your thigh.
You swing wildly, hit nothing. You fall.

She kneels beside you, but doesn’t strike. Probably thinks you're pathetic.
She whispers, “Should’ve gone for the bear,” and they vanish into the mist.
You were like her, once, at least you were supposed to be. And now you barely survive.
At least, they're gone. It seems your defeat made them think you weren't a threat.

#66: Get up, there's no time to rest.
