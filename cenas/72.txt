#72
Your limbs fail you. He strikes you down, but not with cruelty.
He moves like a man reading a script he’s long since memorized.

You hit the floor. Cold stone kisses your cheek.
You wait for the end. It doesn’t come. Instead, he steps back. Kneels beside you.
You expect mockery. A final blow. But all he does is remove his helm.
It tumbles from his fingers, rolls, settles.

You see him— or what’s left.
His face is not one of a man, not one of the Rotten, it is a ruin.
A corpse held together by will and obligation.

“…thank you,” he says, and with that, he crumbles to ash.

But even as your vision fades, something else wakes up.
A pressure in your skull. A thrum in your chest.
You rise. Not on your own. Not quite.
The Rot has chosen. It doesn’t need a victor, only a vessel.

You are King now.
And the world will not heal.
