#27
You let go, and the world around you peels away.
When your eyes open again, you are standing at the base of a monstrous tree, the same as the
sketch, but towering, endless. It reeks of rot, bark weeping black sap. Its branches hang
heavy with bodies. Your body.
Again and again.
They sway gently in a wind you cannot feel. The ground beneath you pulses, alive.
The tree speaks without words:
'You carry the Rot within you, little hare. You cannot cut away what you are.'

You tighten your hand around your weapon. There is no waking from this.
The Rot has finally come to reap what you had sowed.

#29: Sever the tree's root.
#30: Offer yourself to it, you're so tired.
