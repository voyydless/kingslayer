#56
You climb. One hand after the other.
Until the wall shifts beneath you.
A give— like the stone itself has grown tired of holding on. A section crumbles.

Your grip fails.

The fall isn’t long, but it’s enough. You land hard— on your shoulder, then your side,
the breath knocked clean from your lungs. Your vision flashes white, then red.
You lay there, staring up at the wall. It stares back.
Somewhere far away, something groans. Maybe it’s the wall. Maybe it’s you.

You get up, eventually. Bruised, limping, but alive. You’ll have to find another way in.
The city waits for you after all.

#53: Go back to the main gate, and enter.
