The moss is thicker now. It swallows your boots, climbs your ankles like something alive.
Each breath you take is heavier than the last. The air here is wet— not with rain,
but with the stinking, humid breath of decay.
You duck beneath a low branch. Its bark flakes onto your cloak like ash.
Flies rise up in small clouds from the underbrush, sluggish and fat.

Then you see it.

Half-sunken into a bed of blackened ivy, its spine curled unnaturally, its body twitching
in small, stuttering bursts. A Rotten.
It stares at the dirt, doesn’t see you yet.
But you can hear it — sucking in short, ruined breaths through the holes in its throat.
Somehow, it’s still alive. Somehow, it suffers.

SORTE
#40: Try to sneak past.
#37: Put it out of its misery.
