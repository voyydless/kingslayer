#38
Steel meets flesh.
The creature gives a thin, wet gaspâ€” like air leaving a punctured lung, and collapses
at your feet. Still at last.
You wipe your blade on the moss, though the stain will never come out.
Death is mercy, you aim to provide it.

You move on, leaving the twice-over dead man without a second glance.

#52: Move forward, the Royal city is close by.
