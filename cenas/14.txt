"The King? Are you stupid? What could I possibly know about him that anyone else
doesn't know as well, especially the likes of you." It feels like forever as his eyes run
over you. You knew you stood out, fine leather armour, a pouch on your side filld fat
with gold. The scars on your face, your prosthetic arm. People knew you, even if
they'd never met you before. They'd heard about you. About who you were, what you'd done,
what you wanted to do. The story got twisted as time went by, but the most important
fact never changed— you wanted to kill the King.
"I'm sure there's something you must know, being the only town this close to the castle
with no allegiance to its royalty."
"If you want to hear rumours, here's one for you: I hear he shits pure gold but that
Rot comes out of his arsehole whenever he farts."
"...How insightful."

#15: Ask about the soldier.
#8: “Is there a room I could stay in? I have the gold to pay.”
