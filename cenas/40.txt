You still your breath. Every muscle tightens. You move.
The Rotten twitches, groaning low, but does not rise.
You step over a patch of slick roots, avoiding the squelch of the moss beneath.
Its back is to you now. Its spine curls like a rusted blade, trembling with each breath.

Another step.
Then another.
Then—

A crack. A branch beneath your heel, dry and traitorous.
The creature’s head snaps up, its jaw hanging open in a silent scream.
But it’s too late. You’re already behind it, already gone.
It thrashes once in confusion, then curls back into itself like a dying animal.

You don’t look back.

#52: Move forward, the Royal city is close by.
