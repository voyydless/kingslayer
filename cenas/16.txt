You wake with a racing heart. Not from noise, but from the absence of it.
No birdsong, no wind, no footsteps below. Only the creaking of wood from the fragile
bed you lay upon. The room is small, barely more than a cot and a table. One window,
no curtain. The light that spills through is gray, lifeless.
You flex your fingers, then your armored hand— it creaks like rusted hinges, but holds firm.
On the table, a tray. Bread and a bowl of something that was once stew.
The bread is hard, the stew cold, but it doesn’t stink. The woman you've come to assume
was the barkeep's wife kept surprising you with you she managed to cook with
the little they had that wasn't rotten.
As you pick the tray up, you notice something under it; a note.

'He knows someone’s coming. If you mean to keep going, go soon.'

No name, no signature. You don't know who it's from, but you know it's for you.

#17: Search the room for more clues.
#18: Pack the note and leave.
#19: Something about the note reminds you of a dream.
