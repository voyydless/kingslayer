Its gates stand wide open.
Not broken, not torn down— simply open, like it was expecting you.
You step through. Inside, the air is colder. Staler.
The silence here isn’t emptiness... it’s watching.

A grand staircase waits before you, carved of black stone, flecked with veins of deep crimson.
You ascend. One hand on the railing, one always near your weapon.
Soon, there's no where else to go, you're at the top, in a small hall before your final destination.

Whatever comes next, you are ready.

#59: Look around.
