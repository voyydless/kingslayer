#19
The note jolts a memory through you.
A wasn't a dream, no, though it wasn't a memory either. It was something else entirely;
too vivid to be false, too wrong to be true. You were in a forest— one that was lush and
green, something you'd only read of, a world before things had turned to ash and rot and bone.
Wind howled through the foliage like a scream caught in a throat.
And there, in an opening, stood a figure.
Too tall, too thin, wrapped in robes of bark and skin, face hidden behind a mask.
It stretches out a hand, beckoning you to follow——

You jolt forward. Sweat beads on your back. Your heart thunders against your ribs.
It's time to go.

#18: Pack the note and leave.
