The door creaks loudly as you push it open, the few inside turn to look at you,
and you control yourself to not allow your face contort into a scowl as you
notice the King’s Soldier sitting in the corner. A barkeep polishes a cup that’s
never clean, eyes locked onto your own.

#4: Go up to the barkeep.
#5: Go up to the soldier.
