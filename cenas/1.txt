#1
There’s a town just up ahead.
It’s small, falling to pieces, composed mostly of families that had been farmers for
generations and people who would rather be poor & free than tied to the societal chains
of the city that loomed over them. You could see it in the distance, at the top of a hill;
the castle’s visage was as beautiful as it was horrifying, just knowing he was in there was
enough to send a chill down anyone’s spine.

#2: There’s no time to waste. Keep moving forward
