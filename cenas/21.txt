The fight is short, brutal.
You duck the knife he throws, feel the wind of it split past your ear. Your weapon catches
his daggers as it swings, sparks shrieking into the fog. He thinks he's stronger than you,
but he’s sloppy. Too confident. You break inside his reach, armor clanking, and drive
your armored fist into his gut.
He folds with a grunt, and you waste no time.

Steel flashes past his throat, stopping just short.
You’ve got him. Pinned. Breathless.
The blade presses against shallow into the side of his neck.

"You're better than I expected," he laughs. "Never knew a cripple could fight."
"Maybe you're just worse than you've been brought up to think." You retort,staring into
his eyes. He's still young. Still human. Not rotten— yet. "Strip."
"What?"
"I said, strip." You apply more pressure on his neck, just enough to draw blood. His
armour seemed to be of a higher quality of your own, you could use it.

He hesitantly obliges, face red with embarrassment.
You take all that belonged to him, search his pockets and find a letter. Sealed with the King’s crest.
A bounty. Your name at the top. Your description, perfect.
You throw it aside as you leave Mensfield for good.

#32: Enter the forest.
