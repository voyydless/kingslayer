The throne room is cavernous. Dark, but not empty. Pillars rise like the bones of giants,
twisted and scorched. Stained glass windows— shattered long ago — let in what little light
the grey sky offers. It is enough.
Enough to see him.

He sits upon his throne like a corpse refusing to fall.
Armour wrought of gold, inlaid with sigils long since meaningless. Each plate gleams faintly,
as though resisting the decay around it. His crown is fused to his helm, a mockery of rule
and identity both.
The King does not stand. He only looks.
But you feel it. The weight. The power. The rot.

Blood stains your armour. None of it his — yet.
You take a breath. “I have come to kill you—”

He says nothing. You knew he wouldn’t.
You are no knight. No noble. No child of prophecy.
You are nothing at all. And that makes you his doom.
You step forward, one foot at a time, until you’re close enough to smell the rot beneath the gold.

“And to free this land from the curse you cast upon it.”

The silence breaks. The sound of your blade unsheathing.

#70: Then, he rises.
