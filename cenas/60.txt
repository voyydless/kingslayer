He rounds the corner fully armored, a mountain of blackened steel with a gold trim,
helm shaped like a bear’s skull, pauldrons jagged as shattered teeth. His gait is steady,

The hammer crushes the cobblestone, sends chips flying into your cheek. You feel the sting of blood.
He comes again, relentless.
