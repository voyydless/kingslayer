#32
The trees here are wrong. Tall, colorless, hollowed out like old bones.
Their bark peels in long strips, as if trying to slough off rot the way a man might shed
infected skin. Moss hangs like dead hair. Roots claw at the ground like fingers.
You keep your blade close, your steps quiet. You know better than to trust stillness in a
place like this.

#33: Go to the left. [Mysterious Note]
#34: Go to the right.
#35: Wait and listen.
