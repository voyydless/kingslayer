"Came into Mensfield a couple weeks ago, hasn't left since." His voice
gets quieter as he continues to speak, both of you sneaking discreet glances
at the man. His armour’s stained, dented. The gold trim is mostly flaked off. If
you were any closer, you'd be able to look at the details and guess his rank.
"No one's cared to ask, but it's safe to assume he was banished. Messed up big time,
King turned him Rotten... I'd reckon it's something along those lines."
The King's Men never turned Rotten. That's what they all said. The King held them in
high regard, kept them safe. Even those who never had the esteem of meeting him.
Children across the kingdom were trained to become King's Men from the moment they
turned seven. Ursae, Leporidae, Corvidae. Strength, speed or wit. It was to be
your identify for the rest of your life.
Unless, of course, you threw your life away.
"Turned him Rotten so he sent him here... like our land needs any more of that." The man
scoffed as he spoke.
His disdain for royalty was clear, he shared it with all the freefolk.
