You go in hard, confident— too confident.
You dodge the first swing, but the second lands just close enough. You lose your footing.
He’s on you in an instant. Your blade glances off his chest, useless.
The hammer rises. He doesn’t kill you.
He knocks you through a fruit cart, unconscious in seconds.

When you wake, your blade is gone and your arm throbs. You’ve lost this fight, and precious time.
At least, they're gone. It seems your defeat made them think you weren't a threat.
