#26
This is not real.
You stab your fingers into the soft flesh of your arm, feeling the metal of your armour
bite against your skin. You focus on the pain.
The walls ripple, outside the window, the shapes turn to face you— empty-eyed, slack-jawed.
The room heaves under your feet, but you refuse to fall. You focus on the pain.
You think of the cold metal of your armor, the weight of your blade. You think of who you are.
Your grasp grows tighter, digging your nails hard enough to draw blood.
You scream, the sound raw, tearing from your throat. And the dream shatters like glass.

You wake, flat on your back, on the dirt path outside the town.
The sky is gray, the air heavy with the stench of decay.
The castle looms ahead, closer now. You push yourself upright, breathing hard.
Your arm aches.
When you pull back the armour, you see it— a dark mark, coiling up from your skin like rot taking root.
You'd killed it before, it wasn't supposed to come back.

You press your cloak tighter around yourself, and move.
There’s no time to waste.
