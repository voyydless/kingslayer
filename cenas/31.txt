#31
You run, barefoot and bleeding, hand brushing along the twisting root.
You don't look like yourself, not as you are now, at least. You're smaller, younger.
Your arm is still part of you— you wish it wasn't. It wasn't flesh anymore, it hurt like
hell, it smelt like death. It wasn't natural, you'd been cursed.
You run, and run, and run.
The shadows scream and reach for you, but you don't stop.

The faint light grows, brighter, blinding.
You dive toward it—

You wake, gasping for air, back in the tavern room.
The fire in the hearth has long since died. The room is silent, empty.
You check your arm, it was as it should be, severed just above the elbow.

The castle waits.

#18: Pack the note and leave.
