"Best be on your way, then!" The bounty hunter says, untying your constraints.
He sees your quizzical look and explains further. "The King put a bounty on your head,
said he wants you dead or alive. I brought you here, you're alive. Now you go on and
give him this." He hands you your own bounty poster, with 'CAUGHT BY - ' and his
unreadable signature on the back.
Was he an idiot?
"It proves that I was the one to catch you! And I'll be waiting right here for him
to reward me with the gold I earned."
"Are you an idiot?"
"No, I'm cautious. You think I'm risking my life by entering the King's castle? No
way. If anyone's dying today, it's you."
He was an absolute idiot.

"Alright," you speak after a brief moment of utter confusion. "I'll... go see the King now."
"Yeah, you'll be seeing him alright. And I'll be seeing his gold." There's pride in
his voice, you can't help but admire such naive stupidity.

It's not how you imagined you'd get here, but you're here.
You walk through the gates.
