#41
The air grows colder as you walk. The last crust of bread sticks like ash in your throat.
You press forward.
And there, in a clearing just ahead —
A figure.
Too tall, too thin, wrapped in robes of bark and blackened skin, face hidden behind
a mask. It stretches out a hand, beckoning you to follow —
You'd seen this exact gesture in your dreams.

Something deep inside you recoils.
Yet you know this was always meant to happen.

#42: Approach the figure.
#33: Turn back, there's still time go back to the crosspath.
