#43
You open your mouthâ€” but no words come.
The figure understands anyway. It always has.
"Go, then," its voice starts to shift, it sounds like that of a girl.
"To the Rotten Tree."
It steps aside, revealing a path of knotted roots and bleeding stone.
The air beyond it glows sickly, as if a wound had been torn into the world itself.
You pass the figure, and it does not follow.
But you know it watches.
It always watches.

#44: Walk down the path.
