#47
You turn and run.
You will not let this tempt you, you must kill the King.
The woods close around you, denser than you remember, thorns grasping at your cloak,
unseen things whispering in the dark. You run until your lungs burn, until you collapse
to your knees. You dare to look back.

"A pity, I always thought you'd be the one." The figure stands over you, she sounds almost
human. "You know, if you kill him, you'll just end up the same way." Getting a closer
look at her, she seems both more human and inhuman than before. She had the stature of
a girl, the voice of one, the form of one. But her skin was deathly pale, her nails a
blueish purpleâ€” the same hue as her lips, which you could just catch a glimpse of underneath
her mask, devoid of any blood flow.
'The same way?' You ask yourself, she answers as if she could read your mind.
"It was never him, he did not bring the Rot, the Rot is was brought him to the state he is in.
Once he dies, it will chose another, it will claim the one who kills him as the new vessel."
You were so tired.
"The only way to get rid of it is to sever the Root. I would do it myself but... ah, the dead
cannot kill, they can only urge death to come forward."
