#48
You step closer.
The Tree’s pulse matches your own — thudding, ancient, relentless.
A web of roots sprawls from its base like veins under skin, pulsing with rot.
The air smells like damp ash and sweet decay.
You don’t flinch.
You draw your blade.

“You are part of me,” you hear. Was it the figure? The Rot Tree? Yourself?
“Sever me, and you sever yourself.”

You don’t respond.
You raise your sword high.
You strike.

Steel splits bark. The groan that escapes the Tree is not pain, but loss.
The rot recoils, howling, fleeing into the shadows of the woods. The roots shrivel, blacken.
The ground stills. The forest exhales.
The Tree is dying. So is the Rot. So might the King be. So might you.

Your journey ends here, but the kingdom may yet have a future.
