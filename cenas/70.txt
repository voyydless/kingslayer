The King moves like a statue collapsingâ€” slow, deliberate, heavy.
Yet each strike crashes like a thunderclap. You dodge, barely. You parry, barely. You bleed, freely.

He puts in no real effort. No rage. No fury.
This is not a man trying to live.
This is a man waiting to die.

And that makes him dangerous.
You fight. You endure. You give it everything.
