#45
You move without thinking.
Or maybe the Tree is thinking for you.
Every step forward feels heavier, as if unseen hands are pulling at your limbs.
Your breathing comes shallow; the air here is thick, almost liquid.
When you reach the base of the Tree, you see them. Faces.
Frozen in the bark, twisted in eternal agony.
Some half-swallowed, others fully consumed, mouths open in endless, silent screams.

You touch the bark.
A shudder runs through you, violent and cold.
A voice— that of the figure— slithers into your ear:

"It is time."

The world tilts. Darkness creeps in.

#48: Do it.
