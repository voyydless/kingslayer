#50
Steel meets air.
Then bark.
Then resistance— more than there should be.
You strike again, and again. Each blow lands. You feel it. Hear it.
And yet the figure does not fall, does not flinch.
Instead, it steps back, hand to its side, not even blood from where you've stuck it.
Then, with a soft gesture, it kneels. You raise your weapon, but something stops you.
This is not surrender. It is observation. You stand still, frozen in place. The figure tilts its head.

And so it rises.

It reaches forward— not with hostility, but with familiarity and touches the gauntlet on your arm.
"A pity, I always thought you'd be the one." It almost sounds like a girl now. "You know, if you kill
him, you'll just end up the same way."
Then it walks past you.
It does not vanish. It simply leaves.

#52: Move forward, the Royal city is close by.
