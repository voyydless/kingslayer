#62
You dodge the first swing, parry the second, and aim for the weak pointsâ€” straps,
joints, the places strength forgets to protect. The Ursae is powerful, but slow.
Predictable. You wear him down, a hundred cuts and dodges at a time.

At last, a stumble.
You strike beneath the arm. Deep enough.
He crumples with a grunt that sounds more animal than man.
You still hear the lighter footsteps, they stop... and run, in the opposite direction.

#66: No time to waste, keep going towards the castle.
