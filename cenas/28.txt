#28
You tear the sketch in half, then quarters. The moment it splits, the tavern screams.
The walls collapse into black ash, sucked into a void that roars like a beast.
You fall, spinning, your limbs flailing in weightless terror.
When you land, it is on something massive and aliveâ€” a thick root, pulsing under your hands.
It stretches into the endless dark, twisting into infinity.
Everything reeks of rot, if you're here for too long, it'll consume you.
You need to act.

Your conscious allows you to do one thing.

SORTE
#31: Follow the root.
#29: Cut the root.
