#23
Even through the fog, you could tell; the wind was carrying the noise west.
If you moved against it, you could slip through without a sound, matching the pace of
whoever stalked you. You adjust your footing, slow your breathing to a crawl.
Step by step, you slide through the mist.
Your heart beats against your ribs, each thump threatening to betray you.

But the bounty hunter, eager for a killâ€” listens only for heavy footfalls, a blade
unsheathed, a foolish cry of defiance. He doesn't expect silence.
You leave him behind.
Without ever drawing your sword, without shedding a drop of blood, you pass unseen into the woods.

The dead trees swallow you whole.

#32: Walk deeper into the forest.
