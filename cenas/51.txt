#51
Your blade swings wide. Too wide.
You blink, and the figure is behind you.
A sharp pressure knocks the air from your lungs, not a strike, but a stillness,
forced into your body like cold. You fall to one knee. The sword slips from your hand.

It doesn’t hurt. Not exactly. But you feel small.
The figure stands before you again.
It doesn’t kill you. It doesn’t move.

“Is this all?” it asks, not cruel, but disappointed. “You came so far just to bare your teeth,
ah, how I hoped for you to bite, little hare.”

The figure steps back. Its robes shift, bark and bone rustling like wind in dead leaves.
It turns and walks into the trees. You’re left kneeling there— your weapon at your side,
your pride bleeding at your feet. You live. So you keep moving forward.

#52: Go on, the Royal city is close by.
