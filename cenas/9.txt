“What’s a soldier doing in a town like this? I thought there were none in towns of free men.”

“A soldier?” His laugh is dry, it seems like it slipped out as a surprise, like it had
been so long since he’d last laughed that he no longer knew what it meant to do so.
“I was one, once,” he continues. “I was an Ursae, leader of my own squad, I let it get
to my head. I thought I could serve something greater, but there’s nothing greater left.
There is only our King. And there is only the Rot. This armour serves only as a memory of the
time I spent serving our great King, though I am no longer worthy of standing at his side…
I will carry out his will until the day I become one with the Rot.”
He tilts his head up towards you, sunken eyes wide, unblinking.
You see it now, on his neck, hidden beneath the rest of his armour— ashen, cracked skin,
seeping out blood, pus and something else, something black. He’d gone Rotten.
“The men here… they think they’re free, but you must’ve noticed how dry the fields are, how
skinny their animals are, the way things smell… they think they’re free, but deep down, they know they
all serve the Rot. Do you?”

You realize then— his hand is hovering just inches from the hilt of his blade.

#10: Strike him first.
