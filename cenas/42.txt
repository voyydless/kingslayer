You step closer.
The clearing feels wrong.
The ground breathes beneath your feet.
The trees sway not with the wind, but to the rhythm of some ancient, wordless song.
The figure watches in silence.

And then it speaks.

Its voice is not spoken aloud, but you feel it, like hands pulling threads inside your chest.
"Strange. You bear the stink of the Rot, yet you are not yet claimed by it."

A pause. Heavy, cold.

"You seek to cut the rot from its root."
The mask tilts slightly.
"But would you offer yourself in trade?"

#43: Speak to it.
#49: Draw your weapon.
