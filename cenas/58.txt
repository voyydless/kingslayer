You hesitate. Just one moment too long.
The stone gives beneath your boot, the wall has no interest in carrying you any farther.

You fall.

Itâ€™s fast. A scream tries to leave you, but the wind rips it from your mouth.
You hit the ground like a thrown doll, and there is no getting back up.

The last thing you hear is wind through dead trees, whispering something you almost understand.

Then silence.
